In this paper, I used high-throughput sequencing to comprehensively characterize influenza virus cap-snatching, a process by which the virus steals 5-methylguanosine caps from host messages. Surprisingly, I found that small nuclear RNA precursors are the most abundant substrates for influenza cap-snatching. Further, I clarified the mechanism of viral transcription initiation, indicating that a single purine is sufficient to prime transcript initiation, and that stuttering of viral transcription is dependent on the template sequence. This paper was particularly important for my academic career since I conceived of the experiment independently of my supervisor, forged a collaboration, designed and executed the wet-lab protocol, and carried out the computational analysis (indeed, everything except for handling the virus). Thus, I proved that I can carry out an entire project from conception to completion independently.
